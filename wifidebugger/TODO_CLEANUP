- interface with gdbserver <-> target is messy. It should be clean.
- memory accesses: just cast stuff to uint8_t to get endian-independence!
- endianness-independence in general.
- messy utility functions.
- messy loop-based delays.
- can we not have some kind of malloc?
- cc3200: better structuring for code re-use.
- generic string argument retrieval in gdbserver
