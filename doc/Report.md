# Leash Debugger: Report

Leash Debugger was developed as an internship assignment. As such, a report was written which describes the debugger's background and inner workings in more detail than this documentation does.
Part of that report has been included in this repository, so that anyone wishing to make changes or learn more about the project can get some more elaborate background information.
The report is not maintained, so it may go out of date with regards to the codebase.
