# Leash Debugger

Leash Debugger is a JTAG debug adapter for use over a WiFi connection with GDB. It allows GDB to connect directly to it, as opposed to using additional debugging software such as OpenOCD.

### Platform

Leash debugger runs on the Texas Instruments CC3200 SoC, and was designed for running on the [CC3200 Launchpad](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC32xx_LaunchPad_Hardware) development board. 

### Supported Target Platforms

Currently, the only supported target configuration is a Texas Instruments CC3200 SoC over a 4-wire JTAG connection.
