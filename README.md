# Leash Debugger

Leash Debugger is a JTAG debug adapter for use over a WiFi connection with GDB. It allows GDB to connect directly to it, as opposed to using additional debugging software such as OpenOCD.

### Platform

Leash debugger runs on the Texas Instruments CC3200 SoC, and was designed for running on the LaunchpadXL development board. (link)
