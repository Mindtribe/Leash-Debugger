\section{Introduction}

Many aspects play a role in successful and effective development of (embedded) software. These include design methodology, software architecture, understanding of the platform and specification, programming skill and generally adopted ``good practices'' such as unit testing and code review by peers. Also in the list is the practice of debugging, which in the widest sense refers to finding the root cause(s) which cause the application to not behave as intended. Depending on the project, debugging can take up the majority of development time \todo{reference}.

This preliminary internship report explores debugging from an academic perspective - both in general and more specific research advancements related to the internship project (a wireless JTAG adapter for embedded code debugging).
