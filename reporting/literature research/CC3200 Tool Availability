CC3200 Tool availability

Introduction

TI suggests a few different toolchains to use with the CC3200:
- Code Composer Studio
- Energia platform
- GCC+GDB toolchain with Eclipse

These platforms all have their individual ways to work with the Launchpad boards.

CODE COMPOSER STUDIO

- is TI's Eclipse-based IDE
- integrates functionality from TI
	- Programming CC3200 on LaunchpadXL (how?)
	- Debugging CC3200 on LaunchpadXL (how?)

ENERGIA

- Partner of TI
- Simplified Arduino programming model
- integrates functionality from TI
	- Programming (how?)
	- Debugging (how?)

GCC+GDB TOOLCHAIN

- Open-source
- Only one example from TI (blinky)
	- Debugging possible using OpenOCD
	- Programming only possible using TI Uniflash (which sucks)

THOUGHTS

There is a gap in toolchain support for open-source tools: flashing is very cumbersome (also to automate!).
External flash can be programmed directly for products, but this is not a desirable prototyping workflow.
List some advantages of open-source tools.
List the pain it takes to get OpenOCD working at all.
