GDB AND OPENOCD TOOLCHAIN

GDB is a well-known, widely used open-source debugger. It supports many architectures, including ARM-type processors.
However, it has no features that allow it to interface with embedded boards to reach these embedded processors.

GDB includes a protocol for "remote debugging" which allows it to debug embedded targets remotely, assuming some software and/or adapter exists that can perform the target-dependent steps for it:
- halt, continue, step
- memory/register access
- break/watchpoints
- flash memory
- etc

This makes it potentially very powerful in combination with interface software and adapters.

OPENOCD

Is a project aiming to act as a server for the GDB remote protocol, for as many targets and board/adapter configurations as possible.
Supports many transport layers, adapters for these layers, core types and specific boards to connect to.
